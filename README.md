# Days-of-Intel-AI
Discoveries on how to deploy a model using Intel edge

## DAY 1: 24/12/2019
Lesson 1: Introduction to the Course works


## DAY 2: 25/12/2019
1. Completed Lesson 2.1 - Introduction to AI at the edge
2. What is AI at the edge
3. Important of AI at the edge
4. Application of AI at the edge

## DAY 3: 26/12/2019
1. Lesson 2.2 - Leveraging Pre-trained model
2. Open VINO (Visual Inferencing and Neural Network Optimization) Toolkit
3. Types of computer vision model: Classification, Segmentation, Detection


### WHAT I LEARNT 
* ResNet helps to avoid vanishing gradient problem
* SSD is known for performing classification off of multiple feature maps from throughout the neural network, using default bounding box sizes.
*  ResNet helped open the door for substantially deeper neural networks than were possible before. “Skip” layers helped neural networks avoid the vanishing gradient problem that otherwise occurs in deep networks.
* Full list of pre-trained models available in the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™  [https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit/documentation/pretrained-models]


## DAY 4: 16/01/2020

## DAY 5: 17/01/2020
Started Lesson 2.1-2.4 


## DAY 6: 18/01/2020
Attended #women_who_code  and #sg_spaic meet-up 

## DAY 7: 19/01/2020
1. Continued my research about edge, deployment and raspberrypi 
2. Attended #sg_speech_vino first meet-up

## DAY 8: 201/01/2020
Reviewing my Python programming skills

## DAY 9: 21/01/2020
Continued with my course. Covered a lot today 

Think out loud: Can we say "INTEL" is an abbreviation for "INTELLIGENCE"? 

## DAY 10: 22/02/2020
1. Types of Computer Vision
2. How to deploy an edge app
3. Working with pre-trained data
4. Wrapped  up Lesson 2 and started Leesson 3
